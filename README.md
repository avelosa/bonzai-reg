### What is this repository for? ###

* This is the registration site for BonzAI Brawl.  Due to IT's inability to provide a Python dev environment, the main
   bonzai site (bonzai.cs.mtu.edu) written in PHP links to this one. Being able to write the registration site in Python
   allows a lot more flexibility and rapid development.  This site will be hosted on a LUG server.
   Thanks Michigan Tech IT.
